I work in Trust & Safety with a focus on advertising policy, helping to ensure a safe and compliant experience across digital platforms. I bring a background in data science, analytics, and consulting (KPMG), and recently completed my Master’s in Data Science & Analytics at Georgetown. I’m driven by curiosity, clarity, and impact, especially at the intersection of data, policy, and platform integrity.
